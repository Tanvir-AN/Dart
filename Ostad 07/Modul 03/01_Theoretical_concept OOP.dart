// OOP -> Object Oriented Programming
// DOD -> Department of Defense -> America company -> 1st resecarch on OOP in 1960
// OOP is a programming paradigm that uses objects and their interactions to model real-world entities and their relationships.

// good software have 4 behavior
// Software must be work -> it's slow but work -> not crash, not error, etc
// it can extandable -> new feature can be added -> without change the old code and without crashing the code/software
// it can be reusable -> it can be used multiple times -> without change the old code and without crashing the code/software
// folt tolerant -> it can tolerate any kind of problem -> without crashing the code/software software run -> like without network connection FB show cash and notify user connect network but software work

// OOP have 4 main goals or concepts
// 1. Correctness -> software must be work correctly and not crash, not error, etc
// 2. Robustness -> reactive agent action must be perform correctly -> without performing wrong action
// 3. Extendibility -> system must be extandable -> can be add new feature and functionality without any problem -> adding new feature must be faster
// 4. Reusability -> code must be reusable -> can be used multiple times without change the old code and without crashing the code

// There are 4 main pillars in OOP
// 1. Abstraction -> hide the implementation details and complexity code from the user 
// 2. Polymorphism -> allow different objects to be treated as the same type -> woek same way but have different face
// 3. Inheritance -> allow a class to inherit properties and methods from another class -> child class inherit properties wealth
// 4. Encapsulation -> the process of hiding the implementation details and complexity code from the user

// any programming have 4 main pillars of oop it's called object oriented programming language

// Class , Object , extends , implements , scope(private , public) , Abstract class , interface

// problem can solve by a patterns ->  (Design Pattern) -> each Design pattern can solve specific problem
// after combine Design pattern we create a architecture

//! learn SOLID Principles -> Single Responsibility , Open-Closed , Liskov Substitution , Interface Segregation , Dependency Inversion
